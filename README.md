- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jazdal. I'm a medical doctor by profession, but I consider myself a tech enthusiast as well.
- ðŸ‘€ I have a strong interest in anything related to tech, and I have been spending time self-learning coding / software development as a hobby.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Bash, Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
